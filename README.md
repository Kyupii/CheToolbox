## About
CheToolbox or Chemical Engineering Toolbox is a python package designed to formalize the calculations I have learned through university and professional experience in code. Funcitons are written to be clear, conscise, easy to use, and save time compared to starting from scratch. This code is written in a semi-functional programming style, with a focus on internal consistency.
